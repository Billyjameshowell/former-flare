description: Today I made my first DNB song. I've never produced this genre before. Here's 5 things I learned.

I made a [banging drum and bass song](https://soundcloud.com/theluchini/dan-b?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) despite never producing in the genre before. I think you could too if you follow Arc Nade's tutorial.

And yes I named the song "Dan B" becuase I made a mistake once typing "DNB".

## The Tutorial 
Here is the [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QHSj-5XXvY) link to the tutorial. Full disclosure, the tutorial is to make a song that sounds like the artist Bou. I have never heard of the artist I just like the sound.

## Takeaways
* Start the song with atmospheric samples in the key of your song. Arc reccomends the key of F for drum and bass. F is a great key for EDM in general but I went with D# minor because that's what key all of my samples were in. 

* If you've been hoarding ambient one shots, this is the genre to use them in.

* Drum selection is key. You need to spend some time picking drum samples that go together, then adding reverb and EQing to get them right. 

* Producing at a high BPM is nutty. 172 sounds and feels way different than a usual house tempo of 125. It's refreshing for sure. 

* The snare on the last beat before the drop is sick. Good technique.



## Favorite Technique 

My favorite part of the tutorial was the drop bass he makes in Serum. It is really simple and a great sound. I threw some OTT and Sausage Fattener on it and it was thumpin'. I recommend adding it to your arsenal.

## Final Verdict
Drum and Bass is a blast to make. I will definitely make more in this genre. I'm interested in Jungle and more ambient DNB. Shoutout Arc Nade go check out his [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ArcNade).
