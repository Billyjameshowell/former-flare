## The tutorial 
Here is the [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQiOQmCE2d0) link to the tutorial. It was done in Abelton Live but I'll be producing in FL Studio.

## Takeaways
* start with a jazz bassline sample

* sprinkle piano key samples on top

* 

My favorite part was when he ripped a random rhodes piano sample from youtube, slapped OTT on and threw it in the song. So simple but so effective.
