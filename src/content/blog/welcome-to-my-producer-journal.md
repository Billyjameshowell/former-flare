## Who am I?
Hi! I'm Luchini. I started my producing journey in 2020 when I got FL Studio for Christmas. I was looking for a new quarantine hobby.

As a huge Hip-hop fan I thought I'd make rap beats.Inspired by Kanye I started with soul samples. I soon realized I didn't know anything about drumming (necessary for making beats I learned).

As a former piano player I was drawn toward the simple melodies and chords of 90s/2000s house music. I started sampling rap and pop songs and trying to turn them into house music.

Then I discovered filter house. Basically filter house is when you repurpose an old disco song by adding a filter, phaser and heavy kick drum.

Filter house or French house is the best of both worlds for me. 

It has the sampling aspect that I love from rap beats but with piano chords and a danceable groove.

I especially like to sample old Japanese disco records to make my take on filter house (shoutout Daft Punk).

Ever since I've been sampling and synthing and uploading my songs to share on social media. My first single Trik or Treat even got played at a concert a week after I produced it (maybe I'll write a blog post on how that happened).


## Why does this blog exist?
I love to learn about house production. I've watched 100s of hours of Youtube tutorials. 

I figure I can save others some time by writing down key takeaways and tricks from these tutorials. It's also a way to show my favorite creators some love and promote my own music.
## Content Types
### Tutorial Reviews
I have a few dozen favorite tutorials that I've either used to create a track or plan to. I'll jot down some techniques, plug my Soundcloud and call it a review.
### Plugin Reviews
The plugin game is crazy. There's a few that I consider "must-haves" for the genres I produce.

There are others that you probably don't need. Many are downright ripoffs.

### Song Breakdowns
Song breakdowns are for me to highlight interesting elements, techniques and sounds. An idea I want to do is transcribe drum beats of songs I like. I think I'm a little weak on drum sequencing so it will be a good excuse to learn.
