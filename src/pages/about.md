I am a 27 year old self-taught house and EDM producer from DC. I love to make house music out of old disco and soul records. 

My music is on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0VczFIsniW6UT5LKSipiuj?si=l5P7GVD1Q6SEDotLbrVxzQ), [Soundcloud](https://on.soundcloud.com/ECHLM) and the other major streaming platforms.



Check out [my first blog post](./posts/welcome-to-my-producer-journal/) to learn why I'm writing this blog.

If you have questions or want to work together on music please contact me at iamluchini@gmail.com.
